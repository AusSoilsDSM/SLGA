DESCRIPTION,"This dataset consists of six maps of organic carbon content along with an estimate of the uncertainty represented by the 90% prediction interval. Organic carbon maps were produced up to a depth of 200 cm, for six intervals: 0-5 cm, 5-15 cm, 15-30 cm, 30-60 cm, 60-100 cm and 100-200 cm. The maps were obtained through interpolation of 25,200 depth-harmonized organic carbon measurements using quantile regression forest and a large set of environmental covariates as predictors. Validation with 10-fold cross-validation showed that all six maps had negligible bias, relatively small error and that prediction uncertainty was adequately estimated."

PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
