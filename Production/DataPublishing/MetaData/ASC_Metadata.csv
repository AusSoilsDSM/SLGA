DESCRIPTION,The Australian Soil Map Classification System groups all soils in Australia into 14 Orders. This map is our best estimate of where these soil classes occur. We used a Machine Learning approach to model the spatial distribution of soil classes. This product was developed using observed soil data extracted from the TERN SoilDataFederator - https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/SoilDataFederatoR/help/SoilDataFederator.html and a raster environmental covariate stack from TERN - https://drop.ternlandscapes.org.au/#/Covariates/Mosaics.

POSITIONAL_ACCURACY,The horizontal positional error is the same as for the raw SRTM 3 second data with 90% of tested locations within 7.2 m for Australia. See Rodriguez et al. (2006) for more information.
PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
