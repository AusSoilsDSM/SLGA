DESCRIPTION,"We employed Digital Soil Mapping (DSM) (McBratney et al.; 2003) methods to generate a national map of Generic Soil Group classes. DSM uses the concept of environmental correlation where we develop relationships between a set of observed data and a set of environmental covariates. These environmental covariates are selected as proxies for factors of soil formation (i.e. climate; parent materia; biota; and topography; Jenny; 1941). The concept being;that the distribution in space of these environmental covariates; related to the factors affecting soil formation; should inform us about the distribution of soil types. For example the spatial covariates used included a digital elevation model and its derivatives; satellite remote sensing products and geophysical data sets. 
The model training data was derived from the National Soil Site Collation (NSSC) (Searle; 2014). We used a data mining approach to assign each of these soil morphology observations to one of the Generic Soil Groups. The soil site descriptive morphology data in the NSSC database was automatically assessed against a set of predefined rules to assign each site to one of the Generic Soil Groups. As a simple example; if the soil was described as having a cracking surface and a high clay content and the dominant colour for all layers was grey; then that soil was assigned to the “Grey cracking clay soils” group.  From the original 280 K soil site morphology descriptions contained in the NSSC we were able to assign approx. 240 K of the sites to one of the Generic Soil Groups from the available information for each observation.
