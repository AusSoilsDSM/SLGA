DESCRIPTION,Soil thickness is not easily measured in situ  making it also a challenging variable to reliably map. This study improves on previous digital mapping of soil thickness across Australia using an approach suited to the continentâ€™s unique pedo-geomorphic history. Leveraging three large  in situ observation datasets and a wide range of spatial environmental variables  we developed three models depicting rock outcrops  intermediate and deep soils respectively. Our modelling approach addressed right-censored data  which is a common attribute of soil thickness data  and we applied an iterative  data re-sampling framework to quantify prediction uncertainties. We integrated the three models to create soil thickness maps and associated products of soil thickness exceedance probabilities. Using data excluded from model calibrations  we achieved an overall accuracy of 99% for the binary outcome rock outcrops model  and 85% for the binary outcome deep soils model. Modelling soil thickness of shallow to deep soils resulted in a concordance coefficient of 0.77. Of all the environmental variables considered in this study  those associated with climate data (including topo-climate) were consistently the most often used and important. We associate this finding with the direct and indirect effects of climate on biota and weathering of parental materials along with other factors driving spatial heterogeneity in soil thickness across Australia. While the products generated by this research are not without error  the overall pattern of soil thickness is consistent with previous observations from historical soil surveys across Australia and the results are demonstrably more skilful than previous digital soil mapping efforts.

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
