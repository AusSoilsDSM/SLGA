DESCRIPTION,"This work focuses on updating the Australian national digital maps of clay, sand and silt content. The distinguishing aspect of this work is the inclusion of field observations of soil texture classes into the spatial modelling framework in addition to the laboratory measured data. An algorithm was developed to convert field observations into continuous vectors of clay, sand and silt percentage. Together the approach is based on machine learning whereupon predictions of each of the three soil texture fractions generated across the country at 90m grid cell resolution, at depths corresponding to: 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. The approach was customised to accommodate the uncertainty in the conversion from field measurement to continuous vectors. Existing methods of bootstrap resampling were exploited for the estimation of prediction uncertainties which are expressed as 90% prediction intervals about the mean prediction at each grid cell. The models and the prediction uncertainties were assessed by a completely external validation dataset. Our efforts are compared against the Version 1 Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (v1. SLGA) described in Viscarra Rossel et al. (2015). All predictive and functional accuracy diagnostics demonstrates improvements compared with the v1. SLGA products. The improvements were particularly noted for the sand fraction mapping, followed by the clay fraction mapping. Only marginal improvements were made for the silt fraction mapping, which has proven relatively difficult to predict in general. We also made comparisons with recently released World Soil Grid products (v2.WSG) and arrived at the same conclusions. While some penalty is paid in terms of increased predictive uncertainty due to using field data, in many cases, particularly for sand and silt content, the uncertainties from v2.SLGA were in fact smaller than those from v1.SLGA.

PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
