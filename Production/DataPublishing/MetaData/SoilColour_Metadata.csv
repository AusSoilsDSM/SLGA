DATA_START_DATE,1950
DESCRIPTION,"This product gives spatial estimates of soil colour across Australia. This is done for a topsoil or surface soil layer of undefined thickness, and a master or major horizon layer, as this layer is often used for the classification of soil types. The maps are created to 90m spatial resolution.  "

POSITIONAL_ACCURACY,The horizontal positional error is the same as for the raw SRTM 3 second data with 90% of tested locations within 7.2 m for Australia. See Rodriguez et al. (2006) for more information.
PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
