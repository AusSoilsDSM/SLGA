DESCRIPTION,"Soil microorganisms mediate a wide range of key processes and ecosystem services on which humans depend. These products the biogeography and spatial pattern of soil biota for the Australian continent. We used as basis the DNA sequences from the Biome of Australia Soil Environments (BASE) which were collected over a range of different sites across Australia. We calculated the beta diversity of abundant taxa of soil bacteria and fungi, treating representative sequence data (OTUs) as individual taxa. Two ordination methods were applied to investigate the dissimilarities in microbial community composition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for dimension reduction. We fitted a quantile regression forest machine learning model to exploit the quantitative relationship between point-estimated values of beta diversity and environmental covariates, and used to model to predict beta diversity across Australia along with an estimate of uncertainty. The resulting maps also reveal the pattern of soil biota which can further be used for regional assessment of soil biodiversity and from which degradation induced by global changes can be monitored.

POSITIONAL_ACCURACY,The horizontal positional error is the same as for the raw SRTM 3 second data with 90% of tested locations within 7.2 m for Australia. See Rodriguez et al. (2006) for more information.
PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
