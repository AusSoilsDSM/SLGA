DATA_CREATION_DATE,14/06/2021

DESCRIPTION,"We employed standard Digital Soil Modelling (DSM) (McBratney et. al., 2002) methods utilising publicly available soil observation data and publicly available environmental covariate data in an environmental correlation approach using machine learning to map the soil properties of volumetric (mm/mm) drained upper limit (DUL) and soil lower limit (LL15) across the entire continent at 6 standard depths at 90m pixel resolution.
All data management and modelling were performed in the R programming language and these scripts are available at https://github.com/AusSoilsDSM/SLGA/tree/master/SLGA/Development/Ross/Scripts/AWC
We used pedotransfer functions for estimating DUL and LL15 from readily available soil attribute data have recently been developed by Somarathna and Searle (in press) using data from the National Soil Site Collation (NSSC) (Searle, 2014). Soil property data was obtained using the TERN SoilDataFederator (SDF) (https://aussoilsdsm.esoil.io/site-data/soildatafederator).
The spatial modelling of DUL and LL15 is done at six standard depth intervals conforming to the GlobalSoilMap Specifications. (GlobalSoilMap Science Committee, 2015) ie 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm. To facilitate modelling at these standard depths the observed data set depths were harmonised to these depths using a mass preserving spline method as described Bishop (1999). A total of 20545 soil profiles were splined in this way and used as inputs to the spatial modelling.
We utilised the publicly available Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) raster covariate stack. It is comprised of 154 individual raster data layers. (https://esoil.io/TERNLandscapes/Public/Pages/COGs/90m_Covariates.html). 
The covariate stack was used as the independent variable data for the predictions across all grid cells and at each depth. The prediction process was the same as that described for external validation, except the predictions were made at all grid cells across the entire GRDC region. Using the bootstrap sample of predictions at each pixel, we generated estimates of the 5th and 95th uncertainty limits at each pixel."

POSITIONAL_ACCURACY,The horizontal positional error is the same as for the raw SRTM 3 second data with 90% of tested locations within 7.2 m for Australia. See Rodriguez et al. (2006) for more information.
PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
