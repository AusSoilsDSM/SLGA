DESCRIPTION,"This is the soil pH (1:5 soil:water; Rayment and Lyons (2011) method 4A1) product of the TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility. Each soil attribute product is a collection of 6 depth slices. Each depth raster has an upper and lower uncertainty limit raster associated with it. The depths provided are 0-5cm, 5-15cm, 15-30cm, 30-60cm, 60-100cm and 100-200cm, consistent with the specifications of the GlobalSoilMap. Soil pH data (both field and lab measured) were compiled from across Australia using the Australian soil data federator (Searle et al. 2021). The federator publishes API endpoints that allows one to retrieve and integrate soils data from around Australia. The federator is supported by numerous data custodians that currently include the CSIRO, which manages the Australian National Soil Archive and associated NATSOIL database, and the various State and Territory government soil survey agencies.

The digital soil mapping approach first involved the development of an empirical conversion to convert field measurements of pH into pseudo-lab 4A1 measurements. Doing this allowed to increase the number of available data from just over 27, 000 observations to more than 145, 000 (surface soil layer). All soil profile data were harmonised using a mass-preserving soil depth spline to give consistent depth supports corresponding to the aforementioned depth intervals. The Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm couple with variogram modelling of RF model residuals was used to develop a predictive characterisation of soil pH for each depth interval based on statistical relationships between soil pH data and exhaustive environmental covariate information such as from digital elevation models, gamma radiometric data, climatic data, and remote sensing data derivatives. Prediction uncertainties were derived empirically from a manual repeated bootstrapping random sampling procedure and are expressed as lower 5th and upper 95th prediction intervals. An external validation dataset (n = 10000 including both lab and field measurements) was used to evaluate the goodness of model predictions and quantified uncertainties. Spatial resolution: 3 arc seconds (approx 90m) Total number of gridded maps for this attribute: 18 Number of pixels with coverage per layer: 2007M (49200 * 40800) Total size before compression: about 8GB Total size after compression: about 4GB Data license : Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 (CC By) Target data standard: GlobalSoilMap specification."

PROGRESS,Complete
PROJECT_DESCRIPTION,The TERN Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia Facility has produced a comprehensive fine-resolution grid of soil attributes and important land surface parameters. The data is consistent with the Specifications of the GlobalSoilMap and is managed as part of the Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS).
