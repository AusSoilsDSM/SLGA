## R code for tile mosaicing of soil thickness maps. A number of different products produced.

tile_mosaic_SD1.R : Median soil thickness
tile_mosaic_SD2.R : 90th percentile soil thickness
tile_mosaic_SD3.R : 10th percentile soil thickness
tile_mosaic_SD4.R : Exceedence probability (10cm)
tile_mosaic_SD5.R : Exceedence probability (30cm)
tile_mosaic_SD6.R : Exceedence probability (50cm)
tile_mosaic_SD7.R : Exceedence probability (100cm)
tile_mosaic_SD8.R : Exceedence probability (150cm)
tile_mosaic_SD9.R : Exceedence probability (200cm)
tile_mosaic_SD10.R: Probability of surface not being a rock outcrop
tile_mosaic_SD11.R: Probability of deep soil (>2m) occurance
tile_mosaic_SD12.R: Probability of deep soil (>2m) not to occur
tile_mosaic_SD13.R: Probability of surface being a rock outcrop
